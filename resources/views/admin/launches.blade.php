    <h4> &ensp; &ensp;The World Bank is committed to assisting countries meet their economic growth and poverty reduction targets based on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  Particularly, water resource management is tackled in SDG 6.5, but other SDGs and targets require water resource management for their achievement.  Accordingly, the Bank has a major interest in helping countries achieve water security through sound and robust water resource management.
<br><br>
&ensp; &ensp;Water security is the goal of water resources management. For a rapidly growing and urbanizing global population, against a backdrop of increasing climatic and non-climatic uncertainties, it is not possible to "predict and plan" a single path to water security. To strengthen water security we need to build capacity, adaptability, and resilience for the future planning and management of water resources.
<br><br>
&ensp; &ensp;Water Resources Management (WRM) is the process of planning, developing, and managing water resources, in terms of both water quantity and quality, across all water uses. It includes the institutions, infrastructure, incentives, and information systems that support and guide water management. Water resources management seeks to harness the benefits of water by ensuring there is sufficient water of adequate quality for drinking water and sanitation services, food production, energy generation, inland water transport, and water-based recreational, as well as sustaining healthy water-dependent ecosystems and protecting the aesthetic and spiritual values of lakes, rivers, and estuaries. Water resource management also entails managing water-related risks, including floods, drought, and contamination. The complexity of relationships between water and households, economies, and ecosystems, requires integrated management that accounts for the synergies and tradeoffs of water's great number uses and values.
